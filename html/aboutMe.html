                <h3>Tennis</h3>
                <p>I started playing tennis just for fun in the 5th grade. I continued to play every summer from then on and began playing competitively in high school where I made the varsity tennis team as a Freshman playing 2nd doubles. My Sophmore year I played at 3rd singles where I helped my team win our first regional championship ever! My Junior and Senior year I was captain of the tennis team playing 3rd singles again. In those 2 years I helped lead the team to win another 2 regional championships. Individually, I won the regional championship at my flight both years and placed 2nd indivdually at the state tournament where our team placed 2nd overall. This was the best our school had ever finished. While I no longer play competitively, I still love tennis and play with my friends on a regular basis.</p>

                <h3>Swimming</h3>
                <p>Swimming has always been a part of my life. I started swimming competitively once I was 7 years old and haven't stopped since. In high school I was a member of the varsity swim team for all four years and was co-captain for my Senior year. In those four years my greatest accomplisments were competing in the state meet 3 years in a row, getting awarded All-Conference 2 years in a row, setting a new conference record, and setting 3 new school records. I decided to not continue super competitive swimming in college so that I could focus on other aspects of my life. However, I still compete in intermueral swim competitions and I still get in the water whenever I can.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>I started taking a lot of photos when I got my first phone in 8th grade (this was my first camera). I enjoyed taking photos because I liked that I would always be able to remember the moment, no matter what. When I was about to enter college I began looking for jobs on campus. Scrolling through the endless number of job postings, I found one for a photographer for the University's yearbook. At this point I was a very novice photographer, I did not even know how to shoot in manual mode on a DSLR camera. However, I was able to land the job and because of that, really develop my photography skills. The more I learned about photography the more I fell in love with it. You can look at some of the photos I have taken for fun and for the yearbook <a href="photos.html"> here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Camping</h3>
                <p>When I was a kid, camping was always one of my favorite vacations. I loved hiking new trails, seeing the beauty of nature, swimming in the nearby lake, and sitting by a campfire roasting marshmellows. Recently I have been going backcountry camping where you have to hike a few miles to your campsite where there is no water, no electricty, and sadly no bathrooms. While this may seem terrible to some, backcountry camping has been one of my favorite things to do. The only thing that you have to worry about is your survival. And geared with a water filter and food, it just takes some common sense to be able to surive. So once I knew that I was able to survive I could go on with really no worries and simply enjoy the same things that I loved about camping when I was a kid.</p>

                <h3>Intramural Sports</h3>
                <p>At the University of Michigan (GO BLUE!) I played my first intramural sport during the first semester of my Freshman year. It was for soccer, and soccer is a sport that I have NEVER played before. I wasn't sure how competitive it would be, but I went out and played anyways. Turns out it was very competitive, our team only won 1 game. Nonetheless, it was extremely fun because of the friends that I played with and because I was in a competitive environment, something that I hadn't been able to experience since competing in high school sports. After that first semester I signed up for as many intramurals as I could. Now, my favorite sports to compete in are basketball and volleyball which is somewhat suprising since I never played either of those sports in high school. But I think that is part of why I like the intramurals so much. I get to compete at a relatively high level and improve at sports that I have never really played much before.  </p>
